# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Flutter App

A simple yet elegant implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe (X-O)** game built using **Flutter**. This app allows two players to play turn-by-turn, shows the winner/draw message, and resets the board for a new game. It's responsive and works well on both Android and iOS devices.
